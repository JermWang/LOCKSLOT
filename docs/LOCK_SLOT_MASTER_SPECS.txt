LOCK SLOT — MASTER SPECIFICATION (EXPERT)

1. System classification
LOCK SLOT is a non-custodial, provably-fair, pari-mutuel gambling mechanism with time-lock constraints. It is not a staking protocol, yield system, or investment vehicle.

2. Core invariants
- Total bonuses paid ≤ total fees collected
- Principal is never used for payouts
- Reward Pool can only increase via fees or penalties
- Bonus eligibility is immutable after spin
- RNG outcomes are auditable and replayable

3. Economic parameters
- Stake amount: X
- Fee rate: f (tunable, e.g. 3–8%)
- Fee per spin: F = f·X
- Reward Pool: P = ΣF + penalties
- Ticket score: S = X·M (optionally capped or sqrt-weighted)

4. Tier model (inverted rarity)
Brick: ~55%, 14–21d, 1.2–2.0×
Mid: ~30%, 7–14d, 1.8–3.5×
Hot: ~12%, 3–7d, 3.0–7.0×
Legendary: ~2.5%, 1–3d, 7.0–12×
Mythic: ~0.5%, ~1d, 12–20×

Only Legendary + Mythic participate in bonus payouts.

5. Bonus distribution
For each winning ticket i:
bonus_i = P * (S_i / Σ S_j for j ∈ winners)

If no winners occur, P rolls over.

6. RNG & fairness
- serverSeed committed via hash pre-game
- clientSeed supplied per spin
- nonce increments per spin
- hash(serverSeed || clientSeed || nonce) → u ∈ (0,1)
- u maps deterministically to tier, duration, multiplier
- serverSeed revealed post-game for verification

7. Early exit mechanic (optional)
- Player may exit early
- Forfeits all bonus eligibility
- Pays penalty ≥ remaining expected value
- Penalty is added to Reward Pool

8. Whale mitigation
- Optional cap on effective score S_max
- Or sqrt-weighted scoring
- Prevents single-ticket domination

9. Lifecycle constraints
- Game duration: 14–21 days hard stop
- No new spins after cutoff
- All locks resolve naturally
- Final bonuses distributed
- Contract becomes inert

10. Legal & framing notes
- No promised returns
- No yield/APR language
- Entertainment-first framing
- Outcomes are random and peer-funded
- Explicit loss risk disclosures

LOCK SLOT is intentionally unfair in expectation. Pain funds glory.
